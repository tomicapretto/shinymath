The idea is to have an app "similar" to Geogebra, but very minimal.

Here you can put one or more equations.
Set parameters for the equation.
They are automatically added to a plotly plot.
OPTIONAL: Find mins and maxs

In some future work, we can get derivatives and all that. That would be an incentivation for other people.

Things to develop.

* The function has to be plotted along all the domain that is displayed.
  Is it possible to access that property within plotly?
  If not, use -20 and 20 by default, and that's it.
* If possible and not very difficult add the typical three dots menu to open for
  options for each function. There we have "Find minimum", "Find maximum" and
  maybe Show/Hide function.
