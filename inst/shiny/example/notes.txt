The idea is to have an app "similar" to Geogebra, but very minimal.

Here you can put one or more equations. Set parameters for the equation. They are automatically added to a plotly plot. Then you can find mins and maxs.

In some future work, we can get derivatives and all that. That would be an incentivation for other people.

Things to develop.

* mathInput and button next to it to insert the equation. Get inspired on what I've done for other app.
  This inserts a div with the math equation (possibly rendered in latex via MathJax from Shiny).
  Don't use notifications to check values. Use shinyFeedback.
  I still have to choose if I run shinyFeedback after 500ms the user stopped writing input or if it is done immediately after
  (which is actually 250ms because of the debounce policy rate) or if I wait the user clicks on the button. I think it should give
  the feedback before the user clicks on the button.
* Pass mathInput to latex2fun. Obtain arguments and create sliderInputs for each argument, only if the argument hasn't been used yet..
  Values -5 to 5, by 0.1. Fixed for now. Being able to modify that within the app without interferring too much in the UI will not be simple.
* The function has to be plotted along all the domain that is displayed. Is it possible to access that property within plotly?
  If not, use -20 and 20 by default, and that's it.
* Fucntions go on a panel on a sidebar that has a scroll bar (like geogebra).
* If possible and not very difficult add the typical three dots menu to open for options for each function. There we have "Find minimum", "Find maximum" and
maybe Show/Hide function.
* Use shinydashboard?



* El sidebarpanel tiene un div para las ecuaciones, a su vez cada ecuacion
va en un nuevo div donde se agrega ademas de la ecuacion, los parametros
quie se agreguien con ella (es decir, parametros usados ne la funcion que aun
no hayan sido cargados por otra ecuacion)
